# Mail over HTTPS (MoHTTPS) by Notiar Research

This is a PoC of a mail server that uses HTTPS REST API instead of classic mail protocols. It is written to be modern, versatile and secure while conserving certain features of traditional mail. It is the base work for a future Notiar mail services.

We want to make this technology open source and easy to use by everyone. We would really like to make this the industry standard for mail services (yeah, we like to be naive).
